Docker:
1. Create a sample docker container with a Node.js Express app and demonstrate the installation.
Guidelines :
● You should be able to find what system packages are needed by looking through the app
● You should not need to change the app code in any way
● The app should be running as a non-privileged user
● The app should be automatically restarted if crashes or is killed
● The app should maximize all of the available CPUs
● Timezone should be in IST
● Follow best practices when writing a dockerfile
